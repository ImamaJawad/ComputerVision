## Project Overview
This project explores different approaches to image classification, comparing:
- **Hand-crafted features** (SIFT, ORB + Fisher Vector + classifier)  
- **Simple feed-forward Neural Network**  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs)**  

All code, experiments, and results are contained in a single Jupyter notebook:  
ðŸ‘‰ `ComputerVision/Imama_Jawad_Code_40462364.ipynb`
